-------------------------------------------

- Node.js (LTS v24) — backend runtime.
- Express 4.x — simple, well-known HTTP framework.
- Socket.IO 4.x — real-time WebSocket abstraction used for messaging.
- React 19.x + TypeScript 5.x — frontend UI and type safety.
- Vite — fast frontend dev server and build.
- pnpm — package manager used across the repo (fast installs with lockfile).

Why these choices:
- Focus on developer experience, modern toolchain and runtime stability.
- Code structured for readability, maintainability and reuse.
